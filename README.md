#  Data Secure Application

 Data secure application  where information is encoded and can only be accessed or decrypted by a user with the correct encryption key.
 This application helps to encrypt the data and store the  information hidden and secure . This protects the confidentiality of the data so that if an unauthorized person gained access to the storage device or service, they would be unable to see the data.Only the person with the secrect key can able the access the data information.

 

### To Download this Application
 ##### Run this command in your terminal
 ```Python3
 git clone https://github.com/vasumsv/Data-Secure-Application.git
 ```
 After running this command the **Data Secure Application** project folder will be downloaded in your system.

  Once you run the project ,the project will look like this
 

 ### Main Page

This is the main page where we can find find two option **Encrypt** and **Decrypt** .


 ### Encryption Form 



![2](https://github.com/vasumsv/Data-Secure-Application/blob/master/Screenshots/2.png)



 In _Encryption Form_ we will find a option to select our file and encrypt the data.


### Select File

once we click the **Select your file** option,this will open a dialog box where we can select our data file from our computer . 


### Encryption Process



![4](https://github.com/vasumsv/Data-Secure-Application/blob/master/Screenshots/4.png)



The  _Data Secure Application_ use the **AES Algorithm** for encrypting the data .

**AES Algorithm** :The **Advanced Encryption Standard** (AES) is a fast and secure form of encryption that keeps prying eyes away from our data. We see it in messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal, programs like VeraCrypt and WinZip, in a range of hardware and a variety of other technologies that we use all of the time.

**AES** uses a 128-bit block size, in which data is divided into a four-by-four array containing 16 bytes.

In this application the **secrect key** should contain 16 digits of numbers or Alphabets.Even combination  of  both alphabets and numbers to form a secrect key is also possible .  


### Decryption Process



![6](https://github.com/vasumsv/Data-Secure-Application/blob/master/Screenshots/6.png)



To access the data information of encrypted file or encrypted message the user need the enter the correct **Secrecr Key** to decrypt .






By default the encrypted file is saved as **Encrypted_File** and decrypted file is saved as **Decrypted_File** .

And both **Encrypted_File** and **Decrypted_File** will be saved is **Local Disk(D)**.
